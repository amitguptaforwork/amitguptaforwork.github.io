For New Projects that have readme in github
------------------------------
 - simply need to add link
 - Add the link in index.html.  Example
     <a class="project-link" onclick="loadReadme('dataanalytics_portfolio_projects','ProductAnalyticsPyramidMetricTreeGenerator')">ProductAnalyticsPyramidMetricTreeGenerator</a>
    


For posts, I am using word.
------------------------------
  Here is the workflow: 

  Create text in word, save as html
  It will generate an <filename>_files folder
  Copy this folder inside the images folder under post/images and also in images folder in root
  Edit the htm file to prepend images/ to wherever the folder was referred.

  Finally edit the index.html to add link to this page.

    <!--Add blog article links here manually-->
        <summary>Blog Articles</summary>



For hashnode Articles
------------------------------
  1. use httrack to mirror the website  
  E:\tools\httrack_x64-noinst-3.49.2\httrack


  i already mirrored it once inside of the posts folder
  so my understading is, if i add a new articule, i can update this mirror
  and then add teh link to the Blog Articles to this local html file.
