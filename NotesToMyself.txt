for posts, I am using word.

Here is the workflow: 

Create text in word, save as html
It will generate an <filename>_files folder
Copy this folder inside the images folder under post/images and also in images folder in root
Edit the htm file to prepend images/ to wherever the folder was referred.

Finally edit the index.html to add link to this page.
