# Analogy 1
- Imagine you are a BCCI selector.  Team is going to Australia. You need to choose a bowler who will do well as per conditions there.
- You choose a fast bowler = choosing a model
- Then you train him further on pitches that resemble Australian pitches= training the model
- Then he is sent in the team and he play there = predictions by model

# Analogy 2
- Imagine you are a Movie Director making a movie Dangal that requires excellent body, excellent acting and mass appeal.  You need to choose a lead actor. 
- You choose Aamir Khan= choosing a model
- Then you prepare him further as per script of movie. In one part of movie he is overweight, in another he is very fit and young= training the model
- Then he gives his performance in movie = predictions by model


# Main idea is- 
-	Multiple Model skeletons are already there in the libraries like Scikit Learn .  
-	We choose a model appropriate to our requirement based on our understanding of the problem (supervised, unsupervised, regression, classification etc)
-	Then we give our data to it, so it gets trained on our data. 
-	Then we use it to predict
