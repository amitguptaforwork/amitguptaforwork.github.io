  <h1>📘 MCAR, MAR, MNAR — The Classroom Story</h1>

  <div class="example">
    <h2>1. MCAR – Missing Completely At Random</h2>
    <p><strong>Story:</strong> A sudden <strong>gust of wind</strong> 🌬️ blows some kids’ homework papers out the window. 
       It had nothing to do with how good or bad their work was or who they are. Pure chance!</p>
    <p><strong>Key idea:</strong> Missingness has <u>nothing to do</u> with the student or the score. 
       Dropping the missing ones still gives you a representative sample.</p>
    <p class="analogy">💡 Real-world analogy: A lab machine randomly crashes and corrupts some test results.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <h2>2. MAR – Missing At Random</h2>
    <p><strong>Story:</strong> Students who play <strong>football</strong> ⚽ often forget to hand in homework 
       because practice runs late. But <em>within</em> the football group, the decision to hand in 
       has nothing to do with how good their homework was.</p>
    <p><strong>Key idea:</strong> Missingness is related to some <u>observed factor</u> (football), 
       but not the actual score.</p>
    <p class="analogy">💡 Real-world analogy: Older survey respondents are less likely to report income 
       → depends on age (observed), not income value itself.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <h2>3. MNAR – Missing Not At Random</h2>
    <p><strong>Story:</strong> Some students hide their homework if it’s <strong>really bad</strong> 🫣. 
       The worse the homework, the more likely it goes missing.</p>
    <p><strong>Key idea:</strong> Missingness depends <u>directly</u> on the <em>value itself</em> 
       (bad scores → more missing). Hardest case to deal with.</p>
    <p class="analogy">💡 Real-world analogy: High-income people avoid disclosing income → 
       missingness depends on the true income itself.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>📝 Recap</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MCAR:</strong> Wind blows the papers away → purely random.</li>
    <li><strong>MAR:</strong> Football kids forget → depends on observed (football), not score.</li>
    <li><strong>MNAR:</strong> Kids hide bad homework → depends on actual missing value itself.</li>
  </ul>
